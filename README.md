# Basic NFT Marketplace

## Introduction 
NFTs are rapidly becoming one of the most lucrative and exciting part of web 3.0. The goal of this project is to create a basic NFT marketplace and in the process learn more about solidity and web 3.0 

## Things learnt
- **Smart contracts:** programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. A smart contract is an agreement between two people in the form of computer code.
- **Solidity syntax**
- **Events**: put simply, events provide ways to communicate with a client application or front-end website that something has happened on the blockchain
- **Solidity functions and types**
    - **public**: can be called by anyone
    - **private**: called only be called by its own contract 
    - **internal**: can only be called by its own contract as well as contracts that inherit from its contract
    - **external**: can only be called by external contracts
- **Structs and Enums:** Enums and structs are used to create user-defined data types or structures in solidity
- **Mapping:** mappings are used to store the data in the form of key-value pairs, a key can be any of the built-in data types but reference types are not allowed while the value can be of any type. It is similar to a dictionary in python
